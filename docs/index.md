# Getting Started

**[`Immichporter`](https://github.com/burgdev/immichporter)** retrieves metadata not available in google takeout, including shared albums, assets, and shared users. You can use this data to update assets in Immich, re-add users to shared albums, and even move assets to their correct owners.

!!! important
    * This tool does not download any images from google photos. It only exports the information into a local database.
    * Make sure to manually save all shared pictures in google photos before running a takeout.
